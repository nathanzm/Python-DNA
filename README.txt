GENERAL DESCRIPTIONS OF PROJECTS:

- megavirus_chiliensis: reads FASTA formatted input files filled with DNA to print a summary of Chargaff's numbers.

- reading_frames: relates DNA, RNA, and different proteins through various reading frames of DNA strings

- TATA-box: investigates various upstream DNA sequences through different motifs beginning with TATA.

- genomic-signature: finds various motifs in DNA strings based on a given length and determines their frequencies, which in turn helps determine the genomic signature of any given DNA.
